# Product Operations Manager Interview 

## Background 

Product Operations Managers are frequently fielding requests from large enterprise customers who are trying to adapt the data that FOSSA provides into a format that they can use. 

This is a domain-specific question. You're totally not expected to know everything so ask any questions to clarify the problem. 


## Problem

FOSSA currently returns a set of Issues in the following format ([example found here](./sample-issues-response.json)).

![issue](./issue-format.png)

However, one of our large customers is requesting a different format ([example found here](./customer-api-request.json)).

How do you handle this kind of request?
